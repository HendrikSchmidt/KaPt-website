Building on their respective experiences as project managers for almost a decade each, at international architecture agencies (Richard Rogers, Studio Odile Decq, Agence Ter), they decided to work together on a range of scales, from urban projects to space and furniture design. They also collaborate in an academic context, teaching together at an architecture school since 2020. KAPT designs innovative, aesthetic, sustainable, and concrete architecture, creatively solving the constraints and challenges faced by its clients. The concern to offer flexible spaces separated from service facilities makes the buildings designed adaptable and resilient in a world where technology is rapidly evolving. A profound belief in the importance of the sustainability of buildings underlies the agency's work.</p><h2 id="method">Method</h2><p>As both architects and engineers, Anas and Théo strive to formulate a holistic vision of their architectural practice. Their double culture, technical and artistic, leads them to formulate bold, poetic, and yet sober proposals, rooted in their context and in harmony with their time. Recent projects such as the family home in Rabat, Morocco or the vacation villa in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, illustrate this vision through various environmental characteristics integrated into the DNA of the buildings. Particular attention is paid to details throughout the design process. Based in Paris, KAPT works on projects with varying horizons, both in France and internationally, and the experience gained from working with great names in architecture as well as proven work rigor allows them to approach projects with the confidence necessary for the successful completion of ambitious projects.</p></div>
