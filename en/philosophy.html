They also collaborate in an academic context, teaching together at an architecture school since 2020. KAPT designs innovative, aesthetic, sustainable, and concrete architecture, creatively solving the constraints and challenges faced by its clients.

Particular attention is paid to details throughout the design process. Based in Paris, KAPT works on projects with varying horizons, both in France and internationally, and the experience gained from working with great names in architecture as well as proven work rigor allows them to approach projects with the confidence necessary for the successful completion of ambitious projects.</p></div>

He studied a dual degree course at the Special school of civil engineering in Paris and the National School of Architecture in Paris la Villette and works since 2013 at Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners (RSHP), an international architecture practice based in London. Theo supervised the work on the Louvre Conservation Centre site for two years. He is now responsible for the development of the Parisian office of RSHP since January 2020 by striving to take advantage of this dual culture, both pragmatic and creative. Theo has worked on many projects from the metropolitan scale to mastering of execution details. Thanks to his dual training, this structure and systems enthusiast brings a holistic and rigorous approach to his practice of architecture. Theo is also a big theatre lover, being an actor himself in his spare time. Finally, he is a cycling enthusiast whose bicycle collection seriously clutters his Parisian apartment.</p></div>
