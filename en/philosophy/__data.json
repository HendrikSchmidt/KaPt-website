With nearly ten years' experience each as project managers in international architecture firms, they decided to work together on a variety of scales, from urban projects to interior design and furniture. They have also been working together in an academic context, teaching jointly at architecture schools since 2020. KAPT designs innovative, aesthetic, sustainable and tangible architecture that creatively resolves the constraints and challenges they face. A strong belief in the importance of sustainability underpins their work.\n\n## Method\nAs architects, engineers and Urbanists, Anas and Théo strive to formulate a holistic vision of their practice. Their hybrid culture, both technical and artistic, leads them to come up with bold, poetic yet restrained proposals that are rooted in their context and in tune with the times. Recent projects such as the family home in Rabat, Morocco, and the Santa Teresa Ecolodge in Costa Rica, illustrate this vision through a range of environmental features integrated into the DNA of the buildings. Particular attention is paid to detail throughout the design process. Based between Paris and Rabat, the KAPT duo take on projects from a wide range of backgrounds, and the experience they have acquired and the rigour of their work mean they can tackle ambitious projects from inception to completion with the necessary confidence.","2022-12-11T11:42:32.703Z","2023-10-25T19:02:58.270Z","2022-12-11T11:43:51.813Z","en",[8,39],{"id":9,"Nom":10,"Position":11,"Description":12,"Portrait":13},5,"Anas Koubaiti","Architect – Engineer – Urbanist","Anas Koubaiti is an architect and engineer who graduated from École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Paris La Villette and École Spéciale des Travaux Publics.
