It houses a base divided into three platforms following the natural terrain topography and is designed in continuity with the outdoor decks and the infinity pool. The only tree on the site is maintained and fully integrated into the heart of the living space. The leveling work of the base was carried out to optimize the roof: the three suites are stacked to enjoy the same spectacular view sheltered by retractable shutters and a double-oriented cathedral volume is released to accommodate a living space with vertical circulations that can be seen while an office space is installed on a mezzanine in the background. Upon arriving from the access easement, a large hermetic screen facade ensures the privacy of the occupants and participates in the mystery: nothing reveals such an opening and spaces deliberately erasing the boundaries of inside and outside.","2022-12-11T11:50:14.445Z","2023-11-26T17:10:26.626Z","2022-12-11T11:50:18.691Z","en",true,{"data":16},[17],{"id":18,"attributes":19},9,{"name":20,"alternativeText":20,"caption":20,"width":21,"height":22,"formats":23,"hash":68,"ext":25,"mime":28,"size":69,"url":70,"previewUrl":30,"provider":71,"provider_metadata":72,"createdAt":73,"updatedAt":73},"VUE VILLA.jpg",2381,1684,{"large":24,"small":36,"medium":44,"xlarge":52,"thumbnail":60},{"ext":25,"url":26,"hash":27,"mime":28,"name":29,"path":30,"size":31,"width":32,"height":33,"provider_metadata":34},".jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002Flarge_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","large_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4","image\u002Fjpeg","large_VUE VILLA.jpg",null,88.89,1000,707,{"public_id":27,"resource_type":35},"image",{"ext":25,"url":37,"hash":38,"mime":28,"name":39,"path":30,"size":40,"width":41,"height":42,"provider_metadata":43},"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002Fsmall_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","small_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4","small_VUE VILLA.jpg",25.12,500,354,{"public_id":38,"resource_type":35},{"ext":25,"url":45,"hash":46,"mime":28,"name":47,"path":30,"size":48,"width":49,"height":50,"provider_metadata":51},"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002Fmedium_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","medium_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4","medium_VUE VILLA.jpg",52.39,750,531,{"public_id":46,"resource_type":35},{"ext":25,"url":53,"hash":54,"mime":28,"name":55,"path":30,"size":56,"width":57,"height":58,"provider_metadata":59},"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002Fxlarge_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","xlarge_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4","xlarge_VUE VILLA.jpg",178.81,1500,1061,{"public_id":54,"resource_type":35},{"ext":25,"url":61,"hash":62,"mime":28,"name":63,"path":30,"size":64,"width":65,"height":66,"provider_metadata":67},"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002Fthumbnail_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","thumbnail_VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4","thumbnail_VUE VILLA.jpg",5.51,221,156,{"public_id":62,"resource_type":35},"VUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4",371.85,"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdizcp5ddf\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1670692895\u002FVUE_VILLA_7ce63ab0f4.jpg","cloudinary",{"public_id":68,"resource_type":35},"2022-12-10T17:21:36.782Z",{"data":30},{"data":76},[],{"id":78,"attributes":79},6,{"Nom":80,"Localisation":81,"Programme":82,"Surface":83,"Description":84,"createdAt":85,"updatedAt":86,"publishedAt":87,"locale":13,"MontrePlansDansProjets":88,"Images":89,"Plans":90,"localizations":91},"Oasis Eiffel","Paris, France","Restructuring and renovation of an apartment",145,"Aging and outdated, the heavy renovation of this apartment, which had undergone a large number of transformations that altered its spatial qualities, was an opportunity for the MOA and the MOA to carry out a complete recomposition with a limited budget. Consisting of a large, open living space and a separate kitchen as well as two suites (bedrooms, dressing rooms, bathrooms) at the top of a 1950s building located on the Seine quays in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, a clear distinction has been made between the two suites and the living space. The latter consists of a square of nearly 7m x 7m where the original parquet has been preserved, restored and opened on its entire width on a balcony running, welcoming a living room, a dining room and a bar-library.\n\nThis \"jenga\" bar leans on a decimated post, a relic of the removal of all superfluous circulations. Composed of a series of boxes in folding of raw steel patinated, it structures the space by allowing to circulate all around in order to access the different adjoining spaces. In direct connection with the kitchen, its 2m long counter allows to enjoy from the back of the room an unobstructed view of the city and the Eiffel Tower, multiplied by a continuous and full-height mirrored wall that a round and colorful niche interrupts and animates. Through the reflection, this mirrored wall allows to establish on the same plane, a dialogue between the geometry and the contrasted colors of the niche-display case and that delimiting the TV corner. Both freely revisit in three dimensions chromatic compositions of the Bauhaus painter Josef Albers. The kitchen, which can be opened to the living room by means of a sliding door, is designed with great sobriety. It is characterized by a contrast between the bright white of its massive lacquered facades and a matte anthracite on the floor and on the worktops, as well as on the blown glass of the hand-made suspensions.\n\nThe separation between the living room and the suites is realized through a thick partition of 70 cm allowing to create an additional threshold for each suite but this thickness also allows to integrate all the storage, technical ducts, heating system, a water closet, a laundry room and niches. If the large living room is designed as a reception and meeting place, colorful and open to the city, the suites on the other hand are treated as retreat spaces and of great chromatic neutrality consisting of a soft contrast of white and light gray that is systematically applied to walls, floors and ceilings. The work of indirect lighting allows to create a cottony atmosphere on unified surfaces that animate the oxidized and patinated steel sconces designed in collaboration with the artisan Rosalie Pericaud. In the bathrooms, round mosaic planes bring touches of texture to the white sides of the worktops and Italian showers.","2022-12-11T11:56:28.345Z","2023-12-10T21:08:05.931Z","2022-12-11T11:56:31.132Z",false,{"data":30},{"data":30},{"data":92},[],{"id":94,"attributes":95},4,{"Nom":96,"Localisation":97,"Programme":98,"Surface":99,"Description":100,"createdAt":101,"updatedAt":102,"publishedAt":103,"locale":13,"MontrePlansDansProjets":88,"Images":104,"Plans":562,"localizations":563},"Bioclimatic Ribat","Rabat, Morocco","Family house",370,"This family house, strives to coexist both a desire for openness & intimacy in the heart of the Moroccan capital, Rabat.

Elle présente une allure monolithique et silencieuse dont les contours et les arrêtes saillantes sont perpétuellement redessinées par la course du soleil. \n\nBien que compacte et introvertie de prime abord, cette architecture révèle, un fois à l’intérieur, une sensualité et une générosité qui se déploie sur ses trois niveaux, où les frontières extérieur\u002Fintérieur sont gommées pour offrir des espaces de vie ouverts. Les principes bioclimatiques ont permis de trouver des compromis entre lumière naturelle et confort thermique au fil des saisons dans un système où l'atrium joue un rôle clé dans l'organisation spatiale. \n\nPar son organisation et sa méthode de construction, ce projet est doté d’une clarté et d’une lisibilité particulière. La simplicité de son architecture renforce l’identité particulière de sa mise en scène. Il emprunte à l’esthétique dépouillée et monolithique des ribats, forteresses médiévales que l’on retrouve dans le paysage rabati et qui ont donné leur nom à la ville. Son allure fortifiée et faussement hermétique intrigue et suscite la curiosité en ne donnant à voir que l’essentiel.\n","2022-12-10T17:28:36.134Z","2023-12-10T20:36:05.657Z","2023-12-10T20:36:05.638Z","fr-FR"],"uses":{"dependencies":["https://kapt-cms-production.up.railway.app/api/projects?populate=*&locale=en"]}}]}
