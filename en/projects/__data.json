This \"jenga\" bar is supported by an off-centre post, a remnant of the elimination of all unnecessary circulation. It structures the space by allowing people to move around it to access the various adjoining areas. Directly connected to the kitchen, its 2-metre long counter offers an uninterrupted view of the city and the Eiffel Tower from the back of the room, enhanced by a continuous, full-height mirror wall that is interrupted and enlivened by a round, colourful niche. The kitchen, which opens onto the living room via a sliding door, has been designed with great great sobriety in mind.\n\nThe living room is separated from the en suite bedrooms by a thick partition, creating an additional threshold for each suite. Using this thickness allows all the storage space, technical ducts, heating system and watercloset to be integrated. While the main living room has been designed as a colourful reception and meeting area open to the city, the suites have been treated as retreats with a very neutral colour scheme.","2022-12-11T11:56:28.345Z","2023-12-10T21:12:11.387Z","2022-12-11T11:56:31.132Z","en",{"data":15},[16,72,116,159,201,243],{"id":17,"attributes":18},70,{"name":19,"alternativeText":20,"caption":20,"width":21,"height":22,"formats":23,"hash":65,"ext":25,"mime":28,"size":66,"url":67,"previewUrl":20,"provider":68,"provider_metadata":69,"createdAt":70,"updatedAt":71},"©

bar-bibliothèque. Ce bar « jenga » vient s’appuyer sur un poteau décentré, reliquat de la suppression de toutes les circulations superflues. Il structure l’espace en permettant de circuler tout autour afin d’accèder aux différents espaces attenants. En connexion directe avec la cuisine, son comptoir long de 2m permet de profiter depuis le fond de la pièce d’une vue imprenable sur la ville et la Tour eiffel, démultipliée par une paroi miroir continue et toute hauteur qu’une niche ronde et colorée vient interrompre et animer. La cuisine pouvant s’ouvrir sur le salon au moyen d’un galandage est pensée dans une grande sobriété.\n\nLa séparation entre salon et les chambres en suite est réalisée à travers une cloison épaisse permettant de créer un seuil supplémentaire pour chaque suite. Habiter cette épaisseur permet d’y intégrer l’ensemble des rangements, des gaines techniques, du système de chauffage, un watercloset. Si le grand salon est pensé comme un lieu de réception, et de rencontre, coloré et ouvert sur la ville, les suites quant à elles sont traités comme des espaces de retraite et de grande neutralité chromatique.","2022-12-10T17:26:56.496Z","2023-12-10T21:12:11.327Z","2023-12-10T21:12:11.319Z","fr-FR",{"id":298,"attributes":299},5,{"Nom":300,"Localisation":301,"Programme":302,"Surface":303,"Description":304,"createdAt":305,"updatedAt":306,"publishedAt":307,"locale":13,"Images":308,"localizations":630},"Ecolodge in Santa Teresa","Santa Teresa, Costa Rica","Hospitality",450,"In Santa Teresa, wild nature meets the Pacific Ocean in a truly poetic setting. Bright sunlight filters through the jungle to create an intimate yet generous environment for locals and visitors alike. The ecolodge is set amidst lush rainforest and abundant wildlife, making it the ideal place to reconnect with nature. It has been designed to minimise its impact on the environment while celebrating local culture. Using bioclimatic and passive principles, the architecture is designed to blend seamlessly into the natural landscape, with a simple aesthetic that fades into the background in favour of the natural beauty of the area.\n\nThe ecolodge is located in a natural clearing overlooking the jungle, 20 metres below. The first phase of the project consists of 6 casitas set on the hillside overlooking the rainforest. The second phase will see the construction of a public villa dedicated to leisure, sport and well-being. Perched at the top of the site, it will be sheltered by a large canopy roof that opens onto the vast landscape and the treetops as far as the eye can see. The ground floor, which follows the natural terrain, is continuous with the panoramic deck.\n\nAt different scales, the villa and the casitas share a common architectural language and are organised according to the same principles. Each part of the project offers a different experience of immersion and dialogue with the vast surrounding jungle, while ensuring the utmost respect for its ecosystem, where the human presence finds its place with delicacy and humility.","2022-12-11T11:50:14.445Z","2023-12-13T19:11:01.691Z","2022-12-11T11:50:18.691Z",{"data":309},[310,360,409,451,498,544,590],{"id":311,"attributes":312},78,{"name":313,"alternativeText":20,"caption":20,"width":314,"height":315,"formats":316,"hash":354,"ext":318,"mime":321,"size":355,"url":356,"previewUrl":20,"provider":68,"provider_metadata":357,"createdAt":358,"updatedAt":359},"©

à Santa Teresa","Equipement Hotelier ","À Santa Teresa, la nature sauvage rencontre l’océan pacifique en un lieu tout à fait poétique. La lumière vive du soleil est filtrée à travers la jungle pour créer un environnement à la fois intime et généreux pour les habitants et les visiteurs de passage. L’écolodge est situé au milieu d’une forêt tropicale luxuriante et d’une faune abondante, ce qui en fait l’endroit idéal pour se reconnecter avec la nature. Il a été conçu dans le but de minimiser son impact sur l’environnement tout en célébrant la culture locale. Utilisant les principes bioclimatiques et passifs, l’architecture est conçue pour se fondre parfaitement dans le paysage naturel, avec une esthétique simple qui s’efface au profit de la beauté naturelle de la région. \n\nL’écolodge est situé dans une clairière naturelle en balcon sur la jungle, située 20 mètres en contrebas.La première phase du projet consiste en 6 casitas disposées à flanc de colline et surplombant la forêt vierge. La deuxième phase, verra la construction d’une villa publique, dédiée aux loisirs, au sport et au bien-être. Perchée au sommet du terrain, elle sera abritée par une grande toiture-canopée qui s’ouvre sur le grand paysage et la cime des arbres à perte de vue. Le rez-de-chaussée, qui suit le terrain naturel, est en continuité avec le deck panoramique.\n\nA des échelles différentes, la villa et les casitas partagent un langage architectural commun et sont organisées selon les mêmes principes. Chaque partie du projet offre une expérience différente d’immersion et de dialogue avec la vaste jungle environnante tout en assurant le plus grand respect de son écosystème où la présence humaine trouve sa place avec délicatesse et humilité.\n","2022-12-10T17:20:52.565Z","2023-12-13T19:11:01.591Z","2023-12-10T21:30:26.201Z",{"id":642,"attributes":643},4,{"Nom":644,"Localisation":645,"Programme":646,"Surface":647,"Description":648,"createdAt":649,"updatedAt":650,"publishedAt":651,"locale":13,"Images":652,"localizations":1102},"Bioclimatic Ribat","Rabat, Morocco","Family house",370,"This family house, strives to coexist both a desire for openness & intimacy in the heart of the Moroccan capital, Rabat.

Les principes bioclimatiques ont permis de trouver des compromis entre lumière naturelle et confort thermique au fil des saisons dans un système où l'atrium joue un rôle clé dans l'organisation spatiale. \n\nPar son organisation et sa méthode de construction, ce projet est doté d’une clarté et d’une lisibilité particulière. La simplicité de son architecture renforce l’identité particulière de sa mise en scène. Il emprunte à l’esthétique dépouillée et monolithique des ribats, forteresses médiévales que l’on retrouve dans le paysage rabati et qui ont donné leur nom à la ville. Son allure fortifiée et faussement hermétique intrigue et suscite la curiosité en ne donnant à voir que

Un attrait, défini par son identité culturelle, sa productivité et sa relation à l’eau, qui ont été les fils conducteurs de notre travail visant à réparer et à valoriser ce territoire. Nous avons entrepris de développer un processus de renouvellement urbain en créant et en réaménageant l’espace public, tout en élargissant le périmètre de notre réflexion pour reconnecter le site au grand paysage structuré par deux fils majeurs. Un fil bleu, l’Odet, et un fil vert, le Mont Frugy, qui tous deux irriguent la ville.\n\nL’environnement naturel est redonné aux citadins grâce à un parc linéaire le long de la rive : une nouvelle interface entre le fleuve et le mont. A son extrémité, le quartier de Locmaria est stimulé pour revitaliser une centralité construite autour de l’artisanat breton. L’Ilot Rozmaria accueille les nouveaux Ateliers de Locmaria qui favorisent les interactions sociales pour le développement et la transmission des savoir-faire bigoudens. Les ruptures urbaines s’estompent, les continuités paysagères sont mises en valeur, le rapport de la ville à la nature est redécouvert.","2023-12-25T10:55:59.479Z","2023-12-25T11:04:26.463Z","2023-12-25T11:00:13.873Z"],"uses":{}}]}
